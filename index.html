    <h2>No more pre-compile</h2>
    <p>These days, we have to do so many things before publishing the code.
      Babel, JSX, Sass and whatelse, they spend extra steps and our time.
      Felt let us be free from such messy things.
      It does all kind of conversion of the front-end codes, for you.
      Foget the past, focus on the future!</p>
<pre>
$ npm i -g felt felt-recipe-minimal
$ cd path/to/project
$ felt

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Behind the scenes, the awesome staffs work together: Express, Rollup and PostCSS.
      Express is the de facto web server on Node.
      Rollup brings the speed to compilation for JavaScript.
      PostCSS translate futuristic codes into compatible CSS.</p>
    <p>But important thing is that we don't have to care about these technologies behind Felt.
      We provide "recipes" which are the combination of tools and the settings. </p>

    <h2>Recipes of the future</h2>
    <p>Felt runs right out of the box with its "recipes". Basic recipes covers the 80% of the cases. On the other hand, we know a lot of special cases exist, too. So we have the mergeable config mechanism in it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recipes:</strong> basic configs as npm packages</li>
      <li><strong>Configs:</strong> file base configs, <code>felt.config.js</code></li>
      <li><strong>Options:</strong> configs as arguments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A recipe provides the information: which plugins we should use in PostCSS, Rollup and so on. We can overwrite some details with <code>felt.config.js</code> or via arguments. It means that you don't have to care about the detail, and also you have full controll of the configuration.</p>
